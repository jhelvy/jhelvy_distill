### John Paul Helveston, Ph.D.

John Paul Helveston is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](http://emse.seas.gwu.edu/) at the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/). He studies technological change, with a particular interest in accelerating the transition to environmentally sustainable and energy-saving technologies. His research centers around how consumer preferences, market dynamics, and policy affect the emergence of critical technologies, such as electric vehicles and solar energy. He is an expert on China's rapidly emerging electric vehicle industry as well as the critical relationship between the US and China in developing and mass producing low carbon energy technologies. He applies an interdisciplinary approach to research, with expertise in discrete choice modeling and conjoint analysis as well as interview-based case studies. He has conducted extensive fieldwork in China, collaborating with colleagues at Beijing Normal University and China's State Information Center on past projects. He is a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese and also an award-winning swing dancer. John holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in [Engineering and Public Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/) from Carnegie Mellon University and a B.S. in [Engineering Science and Mechanics](http://www.beam.vt.edu/) from Virginia Tech.

### Leah Kaplan

Leah is a Ph.D. student in the Systems Engineering Program at the George Washington University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. Leah graduated summa cum laude with her Bachelor’s in chemical engineering from the University of Arizona before moving to DC to pursue an interest in science policy. Leah interned with the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and worked for the Arizona State University Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes. Leah’s primary research interest is decision-making under uncertainty related to emerging technologies, with a focus on transportation. She aims to understand how we can leverage technologies for the benefit of, rather than detriment to, society.
